        <p>
          <b>Summary:</b> Our project is to render an animated simulation of jellyfish movement in water through two broad
            goals: create a shader replicating the appearance of a jellyfish in water and to create a spring-mass model
            to represent the muscles and membrane of the jellyfish. So far, we have written a translucency shader featuring
            silhouette enhancement, in addition to a nice texture map for jellyfish. We have also created a spring-mass
            frame for the top cap of a jellyfish.
        </p>
    <br>

    <h2 align="middle">Preliminary results</h2>
        <p>
            Below, we show the results from our custom shader. Translucency was achieved through allowing light
            to pass through a surface. Our shading term combined Phong shading with two new terms: diffuse translucency,
            which is analogous to the diffuse term in Phong shading, and forward-scattering translucency, which is
            analogous to specular shading. The ability to see through the cloth model was achieved through reducing the
            alpha term of the color vector. Lastly, we implemented silhouette enhancement, which increased the opacity
            of the surface at the edges of the object relative to the camera angle.

        <p>
            Additionally, we began constructing the basic model for the jellyfish using the existing code structure 
            from the Clothsim project. We edited Cloth::buildGrid() so that it would create point masses and springs 
            for the circular cap of the jellyfish. We initialized the pointmasses in layers of rings so that the 
            pointmasses appear as concentric circles in the x-y plane and used a parabolic function in the z-direction. 
            We ran into trouble with rendering the mesh as we needed to edit the initialization of the triangles and 
            half edge structures as well. We added structural springs along each ring to provide support for the jellyfish.

    <h2 align="middle">Progress</h2>
        <p>
            We've made good progress in simulating the appearance of the jellyfish membrane, but could extend our current
            implementation to create a jellyfish surface that looks more voluminous and scatters light from the environment.

            We were able to get a good start to the frame of the jellyfish model by constructing the jellyfish cap. We will 
            continue to construct the spring structure to include shearing and bending springs along the vertical axes of the 
            cap as well. Now that we have the basic strucutre, we plan to add the tentacles of the jellyfish as rectangular 
            cloths hanging from the cap.
